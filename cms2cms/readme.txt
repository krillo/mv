We will be happy to help you.

How to install the connection bridge on your source website:

1. Upload "cms2cms" folder from this zip file to your target website root directory.

2. To be able to copy images during your migration, please check the Target website for writing permissions
on your image directory and ALL subfolders/files it contains (the numeric value should be 777).

To check whether the Bridge files are working correctly,enter this address line: 
http://yoursite.com/cms2cms/ in your browser.
If you see “Your bridge successfully installed” message, it means that the connection bridge is working CORRECTLY.

NOTE!
We strongly recommend to turn off the redirect on your site for the proper work of the Connection Bridge files.
To check whether you need to turn off the redirect, follow this link:
 "http://yoursite.com/cms2cms/bridge.php"
and once it's redirecting you to another page, you should disable redirects in your .htaccess file. 
.htaccess is a hidden file residing in your website top folder.
